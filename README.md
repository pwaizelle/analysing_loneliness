Analysing Loneliness Forum Posts, the Comments they Elicit, and the Responses to these Comments.
Abstract
In May 2023, the United States surgeon general put out an advisory suggesting that
loneliness and social isolation should be tackled and prioritized like health conditions
such as substance abuse. Online loneliness forums provide a platform for users
experiencing loneliness to engage with, share experiences/concerns, and seek support
from others. On these forums, users (posters) publish support seeking posts and other
users respond by either reacting to these posts and/or writing comments in which they
provide support. In some cases, the posters respond to and engage with the comments
that their posts elicit; understanding these interactions between posters and the
comments their posts elicit can inform helpful communication strategies on online
loneliness forums and online health forums, in general. Prior work on analyzing data
from online loneliness forums did not study the interactions between posters and the
comments their posts elicit. To address this, we present a dataset of posts and
comments published in a 4 year time period i.e. from January 1 2019 to December 31
2022 on an online loneliness forum on Reddit. This dataset consists of (a) posts, (b) all
the comments associated with these posts, (c) the comments that elicited responses
from the posters, and (d) the responses of the posters to these comments. With this
dataset, we conduct analysis using a topic modeling algorithm called BERTopic and a
psycholinguistic dictionary called Linguistic Inquiry and word count (LIWC) to gain
insights and elucidate the language markers associated with comments (to posts) that
elicit responses from the posters. We find that as it relates to comments that received
responses from posters, the following topic themes were associated with these comments
i.e. relationships, empathy, and mental health concerns and the LIWC categories on
second person pronoun, social processes, and present focus, were associated with these
comments. We also find that the topic themes on appreciation was associated with the
responses by posters to comments their posts received. We discuss these findings in the
discussion section.
